Thanks for checking out my blog. 

I'm a GIS Analyst working in the Data and Technology department in an organisation that provides transport for a small little city called London.

For 2017 I am striving to improve my technical knowledge in coding by participating in #100DaysOfCode. 

I'm using this blog to track my progress.
