Feels like its been an extremely busy month and half since my last update. Work went from zero to one hundred mph. Already into our second sprint and Iâ€™m actually full time coding now! Itâ€™s definitely a much more reassuring to be pair programming, trying to keep up with the senior dev is pretty dizzying at times. I just need to learn as much as I can from him.

My personal development goals are on track so far ! Iâ€™ve completed the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures module on Free Code Camp, before August.

Some of the projects were a serious strain on my brain, but some how got through to the other side. I got great value out of the regex , array manipulation and functional programming classes. I feel like I gained some additional tool under my belt which I can start to apply to my day-to-day coding.
