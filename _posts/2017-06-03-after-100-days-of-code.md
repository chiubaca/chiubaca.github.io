I've been coding for 100 days and here's my ten cents on the experience.

I was instantly inspired to start the 100 days of code challenge after hearing Alex Kallaway talk about it on Code Newbies podcast. Part of Kallways philosophy behind the challenge is to not over think it, just start fire up an IDE and start coding before you have time to make an excuse. I urge others thinking of taking on the challenge to do this right now. Stop thinking, publically announce it on social media and just DO IT.

## Why I took On The Challenge

I remember being completely put off programming when first trying to learn Visual Basic for a university project. I was under pressure to read guides, learn the language and build a functional tool to spec in a matter of days . I found the whole experience pretty stressful and it left a bad taste in my mouth for a while. Aside from writing a few python scripts for work I've generally tried to steer clear of programming whenever I can. However, last year I attended a dev summit where I saw so many passionate developers talk about the things they had built and proudly showing it off to thousands of people, it was enough to change my outlook on programming and I realised I wanted to have a go at building things too. 100 Days Of Code was my excuse to kick start this properly. A reason for me to learn anything I wanted and build anything I wanted.

## Thoughts and Lessons Learnt

For my 100 days I really wanted get my teeth into web development with a focus on data viz and web mapping tools. Pumped with motivation and raring to go I threw myself straight into learning React, because I heard all the cool kids were using it and was going to be amazing for...reasons! About an hour into reading the documentation, I realised didn't get it! I had no idea what was going on. This was my first massive mistake - Anyone who has done any web development can you tell you how broad the field is . It's a mine field full of weird and exciting technologies all promising to change the way you work forever. Don't fall for it, or least not straight off the bat. 

<br/>

I realised I had to ensure my fundamentals of HTML CSS and JS were solid before I started building anything, I promised myself not to be seduced by some fancy preprocesser or framework before my fundamentals were in place, and I'm glad I figured this out early on and stuck by this. When I eventually started playing around with things like SaSS and Jekyll I had a much better appreciation of their abstractions and how they were making things easier, rather than just using them for the sake of using them.  

<br/>

As each day passed and I made yet more mistakes, there were many moments of feeling demoralised when I got stuck or didn't understand a concept. However, forcing myself to code everyday meant I didn't simply just accept the fact I didn't understand something. Whether it was watching a dozen YouTube vids on the same topic or simply hacking around in a console, working through the struggle just became normal. When I eventually understood a concept it felt like a milestone. It sounds so obvious now as I type this, but its OK to not understand something straight away. Programming is hard, but nothing is too complex to understand if you break it down.

<br/>

As I became more confident in my skills I finally got around to coding a few things over the 100 days. One being this blog  site built using Jekyll. I learnt a bit about making Twitter bots with [TweePy](https://chiubaca.github.io/tutorial/2017/01/31/lightning-tutorial-twitter-emoji-weather-forecast.html) . I also had a quick go at trying to make a game with [Canvas](https://codepen.io/chiubaca/pen/zZxgzJ). Most recently I have been working on an [interactive air Pollution map using London Air API and Chart JS](http://chiubaca.gq/).

Though it feels good to look back on what I've learnt and its good to see all those hours have actually amounted to something tangible, I'm far more excited of the prospect of learning even more, maybe I'll even revisit React again. 

If you've made it this far, thanks for reading! If you're on the 100 Day Of Challenge or even just thinking about it, I wish you good luck on your coding endeavors.
