## Professional / Personal Life Update

Its been over year since I've blogged. How time flies!

As I get older I find its easier and easier to see the months fly by like days and then you're left in dust wondering where the time went. The purpose of this blog is for me to gather my thoughts and prioritise where I want to focus my attention. 

I am still extremely proud I was able to complete the #100DaysOfCode challenge last year. I proved to myself it wasn't too late for me to learn new skills and in the process I learnt something about myself too.

After the euphoria and the high of completing the challenge what have I been up to? In general life, I've lifted and shifted my life to South East London and am now living happily with my girlfriend. It's been a massive milestone for us to push our pennies together and get place to call our own. In work life, I am now a Developer a Transport for London. I'm transitioning from a role focused on DevOps and SysAdmin to now developing web maps using Javascript alongside an Esri stack. On paper this still sounds like exactly where I am trying to align my skills, but we will see how this pans out in the next couple of months. I still get minor imposter syndrome calling myself a Developer but it is getting better as I slowly level up my skills. Somewhere around summer last year I also learnt to play the harmonica too, thought I'd just throw that in there! 

In personal projects land I've definitely been busy. The questions is have I been productive?I've been tinkering lots, but perhaps at the expense of not learning things as thoroughly as I should. I've heard of this phenomenon of developers having a graveyard of of unfinished projects and I feel I have few tombstones myself now. 

A recap on my personal projects to date:

- London Air Quality Explorer
- [A-Map and AR.js mashup](https://chiubaca.github.io/arjs-amap-mashup/keyboard_controls/)
- [World Air Quality Map Explorer](https://chiubaca.github.io/AQI_Explorer/)
- TfL Live Bus Musical Map 
- New blog site using Hugo

To be fair, I am quite proud of my World Air Quality Map Explorer. However I've noticed my code is not as clean and DRY as I would like it to be. I've been reading [JavaScript Design Patterns](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/) by Addy Osmani. I realise I need adopt some of these techniques to make my code more manageable.

I also recently completed a Javascript test at work. My results showed my skills were proficient but still lacking in many areas. This was a bit of a hit to muy confidence, but made me realise I am a long way to mastery. So time for a...


## Game Plan

 The #100DaysOfCode challenge taught me a lot about my self. Self discipline beats motivations every day of the week. As long as I made coding a part of my day-to-day routine I didn't have an excuse not to code. This principle holds true for anything you want to do do. Fitness goals, learning new skills, pretty much anything. If you want something enough, you will make time for it. So taking this mentality, here are some actionable things I want to achieve by the end of 2018.

 1) Get my FCC Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification (By the end of August)

 2) Get my FCC Front End Libraries Certification (By the end of October)

 3) Apis And Microservices Certification (By the end of December)

 4) Monthly blog to document my progress with where I am with this. 


Lots of focus on Free Camp Courses as I feel by completing them will help fill in any gaps in my Javascript fundamentals. 

As a bonus, I also want to get through the following books:

1) Finish reading  [JavaScript Design Patterns](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/)

2) [You Dont Know Javascript](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)

3) [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
